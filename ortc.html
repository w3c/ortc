    This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to allow media to be sent and received
    from another browser or device implementing the appropriate set of real-time protocols. However,
    unlike the current WebRTC 1.0 APIs, ORTC does not mandate a media signaling protocol or
    format. As a result, ORTC does not utilize SDP within its APIs, nor does it mandate support for
    the Offer/Answer state machine. Instead, ORTC focuses on "connections" and "tracks" being
    carried over those connections.

  <h2><span class="secno">1. </span>Overview</h2>

  <p>ORTC provides a powerful API for the development of WebRTC based applications. ORTC does not mandate a media signaling protocol or format (as the current WebRTC 1.0 does by mandating SDP Offer/Answer). ORTC focuses on "connections" and "tracks" being carried over those connections.</p>

</section>

<section id="rtcconnection*">
  <h2>The RTCConnection Object</h2>

  <section id="rtcconnection-overview*">
    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p><a>RTCConnection</a> is the main class of ORTC. A <a>RTCConnection</a> instance provides the interface for a browser to directly communicate with another browser or a compliant device, for sending and receiving media stream tracks. Communication is signaled through an external means such as via HTTP or WebSocket through a web server or WebSocket server by unspecified means.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="rtcconnection-operation*">
    <h3>Operation</h3>

    <p>A peer instantiates a <a>RTCConnection</a>. Once the <a>RTCConnection</a> has been instantiated and the <a href="#widl-RTCConnection-connect-void">connect</a> method called, the ICE gathering procedure automatically starts retrieving local ICE candidates.</p>

    <p>The peer can, at any time, signal its ICE information to the remote peer. Once the remote ICE information is entered into the <a>RTCConnection</a> ICE establishment procedure begins until the connection is established. ICE candidates can be signaled one by one to each other or at any time (trickle-ICE). In order to apply a discovered local ICE candidate in the <a>RTCConnection</a> the event <a href="#widl-RTCConnection-oncandidate">oncandidate</a> is called by passing as argument the <a>RTCIceCandidateInfo</a>. The remote ICE candidates are added to the <a>RTCConnection</a> by using the <a href="#widl-RTCConnection-addremotecandidate">addRemoteCandidate</a> method.</p>

    <p>The developer's JavaScript can attach <a>MediaStream</a> instances to the <a>RTCConnection</a> to be sent to the remote peer. Audio/video sending tracks can be individually managed by constructing their associated <a>RTCTrack</a> instance via the <a href="#widl-RTCConnection-send-void">send</a> method. The developer's JavaScript can also signal the receiving tracks information by providing an <a>RTCTrack</a> to the <a href="#widl-RTCConnection-receive-void">receive</a> method.</p>
